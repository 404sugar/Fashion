And never on the clothes?\n\nSmall high fashion brand Boyarovskaya, due to their small output, decided to show off their minimalist, elegant womenswear collection with a surrealist show of two looks. TWO LOOKS. Its strange to see under 10 looks in a runway LET ALONE TWO. I didn't know what to expect from a collaborative fashion company between a designer AND A PHOTOGRAPHER but after this, it makes sense. Everything is perfectly done to sell Maria Boyarovskaya's vision, from the music to the cinematography to the set to the editing. Wow. This really shouldn't have been half as good as it was."}
