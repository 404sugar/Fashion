And never on the clothes?\n\nSmall high fashion brand Boyarovskaya, due to their small output, decided to show off their minimalist, elegant womenswear collection with a surrealist show of two looks. TWO LOOKS. Its strange to see under 10 looks in a runway LET ALONE TWO. I didn't know what to expect from a collaborative fashion company between a designer AND A PHOTOGRAPHER but after this, it makes sense. Everything is perfectly done to sell Maria Boyarovskaya's vision, from the music to the cinematography to the set to the editing. Wow. This really shouldn't have been half as good as it was."}

The music matched a lot of the time, but sometimes it didnt fully sell her vision. \n\nMy biggest issue was easily the camerawork OH MY GOD THE CAMERAWORK. With these lovely designs, I expect closeups of every piece, I want to see every detail that Miuccia must have obsessed over, but the camerawork just... doesn't do that. Instead, it focuses on unnecessary elements of the runway show. Its always good to have a Long Shot or Super Long Shot to establish the runway location at the beginning of a show, but WHY DOES IT CUT TO THIS CAMERA ONCE EVERY TEN SECONDS GIRRLLLL I DONT NEED THIS ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ JUST GIVE ME CLOSEUPS OF THE CLOTHING"}

The camerawork perfectly shows the pieces, meanwhile the sound selection is PERFECT for the vibes of the show.\n\nThat being said, the music really did a bad job at presenting the glamour of this collection. Yes, the sounds perfectly fit, but the music wasnt dramatic enough â€” no climaxes, no rhythm changes, it got really boring."}
